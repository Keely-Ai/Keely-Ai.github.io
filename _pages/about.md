<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I‚Äôm **Xinyue Ai** (ËâæÂøÉÁé•), a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at **Peking University**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/). In Spring 2025, I was an exchange student at **Carnegie Mellon University (School of Computer Science)**. Currently, I have the privilege of working with [Prof. Max Simchowitz](https://msimchowitz.github.io/), [Prof. Albert Gu](https://goombalab.github.io/), and my supportive and inspiring graduate student mentor, [Yutong He](https://kellyyutonghe.github.io/).

My research interests focus on **generative models**, spanning both theory and algorithms. I am particularly interested in acceleration methods for training and inference, and I am broadening my focus to the theoretical mechanisms of various generative models (including diffusion and flow-based models) and their applications in sampling and scientific domains.

Feel free to contact me via email if you share similar research interests!

# üéµüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Misc.
- I am a teaching assistant for *Music and Mathematics* (2024 Fall, 2025 Spring online, 2025 Fall), a course that combines two of my interests and that I greatly enjoy.  
- I have been a member of the ethnic orchestra at the *Chinese Music Institute (CMI)*, Peking University, for three years, playing **Pipa** (a traditional Chinese instrument). Together, we performed three concerts at one of the most renowned music halls in China.  
- I enjoy sports and have won several medals in university competitions at Peking University, including a gold medal in Jumping and a silver medal in the Women's 4x100 relay.
