Hi! I‚Äôm **Xinyue Ai** (ËâæÂøÉÁé•), a senior undergraduate in **Computer Science** at **Peking University**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/).

In Spring 2025, I was an exchange student at **Carnegie Mellon University (School of Computer Science)**, where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Max Simchowitz](https://msimchowitz.github.io/), [Prof. Albert Gu](https://goombalab.github.io/), and the most supportive and inspiring graduate student mentor, [Yutong He](https://kellyyutonghe.github.io/).



# üìù Papers
