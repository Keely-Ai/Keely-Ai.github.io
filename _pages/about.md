Hi! I’m **Xinyue Ai** (艾心玥), a senior undergraduate student in Computer Science at **Peking University**, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Di He](https://dihe-pku.github.io/) and selected into the Elite Undergraduate Training Program. In Spring 2025, I studied as an exchange student at the School of Computer Science at **Carnegie Mellon University** and had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Max Simchowitz](https://msimchowitz.github.io/), [Prof. Albert Gu](https://goombalab.github.io/), and my supportive and inspiring graduate student mentor, [Yutong He](https://kellyyutonghe.github.io/).

My research interests focus on **generative models**, spanning both theory and algorithms. I am particularly interested in acceleration methods for training and inference, and I am broadening my focus to the theoretical mechanisms of various generative models (including diffusion and flow-based models) and their applications in sampling and scientific domains.

Feel free to contact me via email if you share similar research interests!
